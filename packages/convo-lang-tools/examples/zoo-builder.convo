Great news! We've successfully built the 'Bengals' Kingdom'!

Here's a sneak peek:

- It's home to the magnificent Bengal Tiger, the rare White Bengal Tiger, and the wily Bengal Fox.
- The exhibit is an enormous 50,000 square feet! That's gonna be a lot of tiger prowling action!
- And the total cost, including our new furry residents? A cool $1,550,000. Yes, tigers are a bit on the pricier side, but hey, they're worth every penny.

Would you like to add anything else to our new zoo?
