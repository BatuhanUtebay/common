__return={"result":"This is an iconic image of four men crossing the street on a pedestrian crossing. It's known for being the cover of a famous album by a well-known British band from the 1960s. They are depicted in mid-stride, and the scene is set against a backdrop of a city road flanked by trees and cars. The composition of this photo has been widely recognized and parodied countless times."}
