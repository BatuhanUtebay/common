# Syn-Taxi
A set of React components for highlighting and editing code

Highlighting is done using (highlighter.js)[https://highlightjs.org/] and adds support for using
TextMate and VSCode grammars using
the (foo123/highlightjs-grammar)[https://github.com/foo123/highlightjs-grammar]

Use the LazyCodeInput and LazyCodeView to enable code splitting to remove
highlighter.js from your main bundle
