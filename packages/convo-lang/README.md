# What is Convo-lang?
Convo-lang is a mixture between a procedural programming language, prompting template system and 
conversation state management system. You can execute convo-lang in Javascript, Python,
from the command line or directly in VSCode.

Convo-lang aims to provided a uniform prompting syntax that is LLM agnostic and allows you to
store both prompts, metadata and tradition programming logic in a single file or template string.

The convo-lang syntax supports advanced features such as function calling, tool usage and vision.
The Convo-lang ecosystem consists of a parser, interpreter, Typescript/Javascript/Python libraries,
a CLI, and a vscode extension for syntax highlighting and in-editor script execution.
